## How To

* Clone this repo
* Edit `example.js` to choose mockup template and target url
* Call `phantomjs example.js`

## Requirements

The only external requirement is PhantomJS in version >= 2.0.0.

`brew install phantomjs`

Double check the version of PhantomJS

`phantomjs -v`

## Credits for Mockup templates

At the moment this script includes two mockup templates of pixeden.com:

* http://www.pixeden.com/psd-web-elements/flat-responsive-showcase-psd
* http://www.pixeden.com/psd-web-elements/flat-responsive-showcase-psd-vol2

The awesome people at pixeden.com gave me permission to even include the PSD files so you can tweak the mockups to fit your needs. :heart:
